    <h1>Polyglatory ðŸ’€</h1>
    <p>
    Herein lies my personal purgatory of foreign language learning
    where linguistics goes to get tortured and butchered by me ðŸ˜ˆ
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I put up teaching materials on this site as I'm learning so I
    can practice writing in foreign languages and you can laugh at
    my pitiful attempts to do so.
